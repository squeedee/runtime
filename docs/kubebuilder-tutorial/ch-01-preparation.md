# Chapter 01 - Preparation

* [Table of Contents](README.md)

## Requirements

* Install the [kubebuilder CLI and prerequisites](https://book.kubebuilder.io/quick-start#prerequisites).
* For a "kubernetes instance", we
  require [installing Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation) for this tutorial. Kind
  provides a simple mechanism for local deployment and local debugging.
* We also recommend [installing GIT](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) as an easy way to
  track progress and revert mistakes.
